# AI Chatbot with NLP

This project implements a simple AI-based chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python. The chatbot can understand user input, process it using NLP methods, and generate appropriate responses.

## 🤖 Features

- Rule-based and keyword matching chatbot
- NLP preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization)
- Bag of Words model
- Intent classification using a basic neural network (via TensorFlow/Keras or manually)
- JSON-based intent structure
- Easy to expand with new intents

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- NumPy
- TensorFlow / Keras
- JSON

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### NLTK Setup

If you're using NLTK for the first time, you may need to download required resources:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. **Train the model** (if not already trained):

```bash
python chatbot_model.py
```

2. **Start chatting**:

```bash
python chat.py
```

3. Type a message to see the bot respond intelligently based on predefined intents.

## 📁 intents.json Format

This file contains predefined intents with patterns and corresponding responses. Example:

```json
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "greeting",
      "patterns": ["Hi", "Hello", "Hey"],
      "responses": ["Hello!", "Hi there!", "How can I help you?"]
    }
  ]
}
```

You can edit `intents.json` to add your own intents and responses.
